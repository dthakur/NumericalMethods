[Note: This is still work-in-progress]

The code has been mostly written for instructive value and will fail any boundary condition with
high probability.

Numerical coverage is based on the following books:

- Numerical Methods, Algorithms and Tools in C# by Passos
- Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing by Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling and Flannery

F# usage was derived from browsing of the following books:

- Real-World Functional Programming by Petricek and Skeet
- F# for Scientists by Harrop
